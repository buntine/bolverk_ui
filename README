================
BOLVERK UI
For v0.0.3
================ 

This Sinatra application adds a GUI for the Bolverk machine emulator. It allows you to write valid programs and then step them through the processor, one instruction at a time.

This allows you to see how the program is effecting main memory in realtime.

For a working implementation, see here: http://bolverk.andrewbuntine.com

All comments and suggestions for improvement are welcomed. Thanks for stopping by. :)
